# Hi there, I'm Dominik Todorovic! 👋


### Aspiring Junior Software Developer 🚀

I am a passionate web enthusiast dedicated to building clean, functional, and user-centric applications. After mastering the basics of static layouts, I am now deep-diving into the Fullstack world, bridging the gap between dynamic interfaces and robust server-side logic.

I am currently at the beginning of my journey, building a solid foundation in Frontend, Backend, and Database management. My goal is to understand how data flows through the entire stack—from the user's click to the database entry.



### 🛠️ Tech Stack

* Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), TypeScript (Learning)
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js (Basic Routing & APIs)
* Database: MongoDB (Atlas & Mongoose)
* Tools: Git, GitHub, VS Code, NPM



### 🏗 What I'm working on right now

* 📚 **Learning React:** Deep diving into Hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) and component-based architecture.
