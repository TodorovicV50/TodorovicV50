# 📝 Interactive JS Todo List

A modern, functional Todo List application built with Vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates my understanding of DOM manipulation, data persistence, and state management.

## ✨ Features
- **Add & Edit:** Create new tasks or modify existing ones instantly.
- **Persistent Storage:** Your todos are saved in the browser's `localStorage`, so they don't disappear when you refresh the page.
- **Smart Filtering:** Filter your tasks by "All", "Open", or "Done".
- **Responsive Design:** Works on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Focus Management:** Automatic input focus for a faster workflow.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **HTML5** - Semantic structure
- **CSS3** - Custom styling with Flexbox/Grid
- **JavaScript (ES6+)** - Functional logic and DOM interaction

## 💡 What I Learned
During this project, I deepened my knowledge in:
- Handling complex Array methods like `.filter()` and `.indexOf()`.
- Managing application state (keeping the UI in sync with the data).
- Using `localStorage` to provide a seamless user experience.
- Event Bubbling and how to prevent it using `e.stopPropagation()`.
